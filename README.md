I was with a friend of mine that is learning javascript checking out this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3XxeE7NF30&ab_channel=TechWithTim
And I noticed that this could be improved in some parts and we could add some extra steps and verifications.

So that's how we spent a rainy night.

Of course some of this stuff could be improved but we were pretty happy with the result we got!
And at the same time we got to experience the importance of not gambling!!!!!
